# Cat Shelter
This is my first node.js project (without express). The project is a task from Softuni.

## Tech Stack 
- fs
- uuid
- http
- formidable

## Functionality
1. You can see all cats
2. See a details view for each cat
3. Add a new cat
4. Add a new breed
5. You can shelter any cat (*the cat gets deleted*)

## Unsolved Problems
1. **Edit a cat**
2. **Search functionality**

## Notes
- The main goal of this project is to write node.js using only core libraries except formidable and unique id (*without express at all*)
