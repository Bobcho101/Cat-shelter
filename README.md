# First-node-js-project-cat-shelter
This my first project with node js. The project is a task from softuni. It i called 'Cat Shelter'.
For this project i used fs, formidable and a unique id generator.
Main main goal of this project is to write nodejs using only core libraries except formidable and unique id generator. I didnt use express.
The only thing i couldnt do is the edit cat and search functionality.
In this app you can do:
    1.Add new cat
    2.See any cat's details
    3.Add new breed
    4.All added breeds appears into the create section when selecting a cat's breed.
